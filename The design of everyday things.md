- [[rote learning]]

### Two types of knowledge
There is [[knowledge in the head]] and [[knowledge in the world]]. We combine both of them together to solve day to day problems

- [[7 design principles]]
- [[Don't criticize unless you can do better]]
- [[legacy problem]]
- [[root cause analysis]]
- [[Human-Centered design]]
- [[task analysis]]
- [[activity centered control]] - problems with exceptions
- [[Forcing Function]]
- If we only kept to the old, we could never improve
- [[Skeuomorphism]]
- [[Collaboratively followed checklist]]
- [[design thinking]]
- [[double-diamond diverge-converge model of design]]
- [[physical anthropometry]]
- [[inclusive design]]

### 4 types of constraints
- physical - constrain possible operations
- cultural - constraints introduced by the culturein which design operates. A culture can deam an action apropiate or inapropiate which can reduce the set of possible actions, as well as accentuate the action that should be taken.
- semantic - constraints coming from meaning of signals in the world;
- logical - constraints coming from the logical analysis of the problem;

### Theories
- [[decision theory]]
- [[control theory]]
- [[Resilience Engineering]]

### Safety engineering focing functions
- interlocks - a concious constraints to prevent a device to be used inapropetly - an example is a dead man's switch  ()
- lock-ins - keeps an operation active
- lockouts - prevents people from entering dangerous places

## Slips vs errors

There are 2 types of human errors: slips and errors

> Designers need to avoid procedures that have identical opening steps but then diverge.

> Designers need to ensure that controls and displays for different purposes are significantly different from one another.

> The designer should assume that people will be interupted during their activities and they may need assistance in resuming their operation.

> We need to reward safety and put it above economic pressures

> Well-designed systems are resilient against failure.

> One of my rules in consulting is simple: never solve the problem I am asked to solve

> The day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget

### Three modes of behaviour
- skill-based
- rule-based
- knowledge-based

2 people should follow a checklist. One checks the checklist, one executes the actions.

### 3 types of goals
- be-goal
- do-goal
- motor-goal
