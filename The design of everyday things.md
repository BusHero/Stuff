# Ideas
- [[rote learning]]
- [[ergonomics]]
- [[mnemonics]]
- a good design requires a good understanding of culture;
- Semantics is the study of meaining

### Two types of knowledge
There is [[knowledge in the head]] and [[knowledge in the world]]. We combine both of them together to solve day to day problems

- [[7 design principles]]
- [[Don't criticize unless you can do better]]
- [[legacy problem]]
- [[root cause analysis]]
- [[Human-Centered design]]
- [[task analysis]]
- [[activity centered control]] - problems with exceptions
- [[Forcing Function]]
- If we only kept to the old, we could never improve
- [[Skeuomorphism]]

### 4 types of constraints
- physical - constrain possible operations
- cultural - constraints introduced by the culturein which design operates. A culture can deam an action apropiate or inapropiate which can reduce the set of possible actions, as well as accentuate the action that should be taken.
- semantic - constraints coming from meaning of signals in the world;
- logical - constraints coming from the logical analysis of the problem;

### Theories
- [[decision theory]]
- [[control theory]]

### Safety engineering focing functions
- interlocks - a concious constraints to prevent a device to be used inapropetly - an example is a dead man's switch  ()
- lock-ins - keeps an operation active
- lockouts - prevents people from entering dangerous places
